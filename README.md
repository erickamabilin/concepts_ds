# Bloom Filter Implementation and Analysis

## Project Description
This project implements a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure for efficient membership testing with a trade-off of false positives. The project includes performance analysis using different datasets, specifically DNA sequences and English words.

The complete report of this work, including implementation details, test results, and performance analysis, is presented in the `demo.ipynb` file. This is the most important file where our results are documented.



## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Python 3.10 installed.
3. Install the required Python packages

## Usage Instructions

### Bloom Filter Implementation and Testing
1. To test the the Bloom filter, run:
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

### Performance Analysis (HPC)
To run the performance tests on the HPC, use the provided SLURM job scripts.

1. For performance tests on DNA sequences:
    ```bash
    sbatch job_script.slurm
    ```
2. For performance tests on English words:
    ```bash
    sbatch job_script_words.slurm
    ```
