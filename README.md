# Bloom Filter Implementation and Analysis

## Project Description
This project implements a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure for efficient membership testing with a trade-off of false positives. The project includes performance analysis using different datasets, specifically DNA sequences and English words.


## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Python 3.10 installed.
3. Install the required Python packages

## Usage Instructions
1. To run the performance tests on DNA sequences:
    ```bash
    python performance_test.py
    ```
2. To run the performance tests on English words:
    ```bash
    python performance_test_words.py
    ```
